# Vigenère Cipher

The Vigenère Cipher is a poly-alphabetic substitution cipher first described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553. This cipher is easy to understand and implement but is quite hard to crack. It resisted all attempts to break for three centuries which earned it the description "the indecipherable cipher".

In the 19th century the scheme was misattributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_de_Vigen%C3%A8re">Blaise de Vigenère</a>, and so acquired its present name.

To encrypt a message, use the encrypt() funtion that takes in two arguments: the plaintext (a string) and the keyword (string) and outputs the ciphertext.

To decrypt a message, use the decrypt() funtion that takes in two similar arguments: the ciphertext and the keyword and outputs the plaintext.
